    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Matthew Plastrik, an amateur woodworker and musician with a particular interest in building electric guitars that highlight the natural beauty of the tonewoods they consist of. This website will serve as a personal blog of my guitar building journey. I will share updates on my work and tips that I learn along the way. I currently work only with hand-tools.</p>
